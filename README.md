Python 3D Binaural Audio Simulation

The program generates 3D Binaural sound for headphones produced by a number of loaded audio sources that can be moved by a GUI through a virtual 2 dimensional room. The sources can be for example instruments of a band that are mixed together to one 3D audio output that is saved as WAVE file. Kemar HRTFs were used for the filtering process.
